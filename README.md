# ruby-chess

A chess program made in Ruby for my personal edification.

My process went something like:
1. Dive in and try to code everything.
2. Bang head against wall.
3. Take a couple days off to read all of POODR.
4. Try again and almost use best practices for a while.

It's still very messy in a lot of places. It's also not complete, but the core moving-pieces-around functionality is there.

Remaining issues:
* ~~No en passant.~~ It does en passant! I'm not *that* lazy!
* Incorrectly declares checkmates when moving a piece other than the king would rescue it.
* Does not recognize draws.
* I'm sure there are other bugs that can pop up.

I want to come back and fix those eventually, but I also really want to move on.
